## Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis of the Hotel Booking Dataset
### Dataset : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Premalatha-success/-Practice/main/hotel_bookings.csv
### We used the dataset that contains data about hotel bookings
### We cleaned and preprocessed the data and then we performed the exploratory data analysis to extract information from the data

## We learned that

### 1. Almost 35% of bookings were canceled.

### 2. More than 60% of the population booked the City hotel.

### 3. More than double bookings were made in 2016, compared to the previous year. But the bookings decreased by almost 15% next year.

### 4. Most bookings were made from July to August. And the least bookings were made at the start and end of the year.

### 5. Portugal, the UK, and France, Spain and Germany are the top countries from most guests come, more than 80% come from these 5 countries.

### 6. Most people stay for one, two, or three.-> For Resort hotel, the most popular stay duration is three, two, one, and four days respectively.-> For City hotel, most popular stay duration is one, two, seven(week), and three respectively.

### 7. Couple (or 2 adults) is the most popular accommodation type. So hotels can make arrangement plans accordingly

### **We then performed feature selection and feature engineering, and then made the predictive model using the Decision Tree to predict whether our customer/guest will cancel the booking or not. And we achieved 85.7% accuracy.**
